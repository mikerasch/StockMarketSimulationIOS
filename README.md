# StockMarketSimulationIOS
Simple WIP iOS application for trading fake money in the real stock exchange.

## Goals
### The Problem
The stock market has gained a large popularity due to popular trading applications such as Robinhood or Webull.
However, many first time investors know little when it comes to investing basics. This leads to people risking
thousands of real dollars in learning the basics. This is essentially gambling because no clear alternatives
are marketed to them.

## The Solution
This application allows users to trade in the stock market with fake money. While this is already a thing
in many other apps, it fails to utilize real-time market trading. This application hopes to allow
buying, selling, short-selling, advanced statistics, and in-depth analytics of a users profile. 
With these functionalities, this app hopes to allow users the same experience as other services, but without
the glamorous riches that comes with real money.
